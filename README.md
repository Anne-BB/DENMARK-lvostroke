# DENMARK-lvostroke
This is a start for the project
It uses the following packages: eurostat, dplyr, sf and mapview. Mapview provides interactive map view using leaflet. The web page can be obtained by creating a fork gh-pages.

The data for the hospitals in demark contains comprehensive stroke unit (CSC) and primary stroke centre (PSC). The geocoding of the hospital is performed using geocode_OSM function from tmaptools. This project is written with codes adapted from https://richardbeare.github.io/GeospatialStroke/. Click the edit button to see the codes for creating this web page.
